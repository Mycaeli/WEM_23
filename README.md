### Project Idea




### Vision

We are looking to do an interactive system that provide to our posible ussers an space where they can play with their sorrunding to experience the tradional rhytms and music of our country


### Interest

We want to develop a loopstation that would allow people to create beats on a 4 times compass


### Proto 1.0: 
We made an arduino system with a buzzer to use it like a piano, the mini piano works but the idea changed to use a Leap Motion, the code still works

### Proto 1.1: 
We implement de Leap motion as a sensor to use in the experience of the music creation, the Leap Motion have some problems maping the hands in some position that we need but in general, its the perfect tool for the job, the next step its to build the intafece in Unity to make it workfit at all, in this case to make the digital piano midi and the compass
